# WalyWallpaper - MERN Stack Wallpaper Store

WalyWallpaper is a simple yet elegant online wallpaper store, similar to Unsplash, built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to browse and download high-quality wallpapers. The project is a part of my Semester 3 project at Darshan University.
